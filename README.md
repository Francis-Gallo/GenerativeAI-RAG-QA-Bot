Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain 🤖✨

This project demonstrates building an AI-powered research assistant using Generative AI, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and LangChain. The assistant can read, understand, and answer questions from large document collections in real-time.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python 🐍

LangChain 📚

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) ⚡

ChromaDB 🗄️ (Vector database for embeddings)

Gradio 🎨 (Web interface for the QA bot)

watsonx.ai / Hugging Face Models 🤖

Google Colab ☁️ (for running the project)

📌 Project Overview

The project follows these main steps:

Document Loading: Load documents from PDFs or other sources using LangChain.

Text Splitting: Split documents into manageable chunks for better LLM understanding.

Embedding Generation: Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using AI models.

Vector Database Storage: Store embeddings in ChromaDB for fast retrieval.

Retriever Creation: Build a retriever to fetch relevant document segments based on queries.

QA Bot Construction: Build a question-answering bot that leverages LangChain and LLM to answer queries from the loaded documents.

⚡ Usage

Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload your PDF documents.

Run all cells to process the documents, generate embeddings, and start the QA bot interface.

Ask questions and get answers from your documents in real-time!
